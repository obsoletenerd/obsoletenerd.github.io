My eldest daughter has been getting more and more into Lego and I was sick of cleaning up all the pieces off the floor, so we put together this quick Lego desk with organiser drawers. She's been using it now for a few months and absolutely loves it, and believe it or not the pieces actually do all end up back in the drawers after each session. The fact she can open a drawer up and then sweep pieces off the overhanging desk directly into the drawer makes it fun to clean up, so it actually seems to happen. 

We found a used set of Ikea drawers from Gumtree that had been drawn on by a previous family and scratched up a bit so they were very cheap.

I gave it a quick sand and scrubbed it all with a slightly soapy sponge to get most of the crayon and other marks off, and get it ready for paint.

Then we grabbed a spare piece of Acacia countertop slab (that I used for my workshop tables and computer desk previously) and cut a piece off to suit.

Once the glue had dried, we screwed the countertop on top from underneath, and it's done.

Quick and easy project that cost maybe $50 total including the paint, and a lot nicer to sit at and play than the floor.

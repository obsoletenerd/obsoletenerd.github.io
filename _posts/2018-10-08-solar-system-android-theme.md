title: Solar System Android Theme
summary: A very simple Solar System based theme I created for Android phones a while ago. Not fancy by todays standards, but I still enjoy its simplicity and clean look. Mostly posted here now for the memories/nostalgia.

## RIP Pluto

I love making themes/skins, and have been modifying and customising my daily UIs since the early Winamp and IRC days, where I'd make custom skins for every single piece of software I possibly could on my Windows 95 machine. Even going as far as hacking the actual software to insert custom backgrounds and modify colours where they didn't allow customisation. I hate "stock", from software to cars and everything around the house, I love changing how things look to suit my personal taste.

I make new themes and wallpapers for my desktop and phone almost weekly, but I never really share them. Just for the sake of practicing writing/formatting/etc here, I'm going to start sharing my favourites.

Inspired by the various "sliced planets" art pieces around, such as [Steve Gildea's paintings](http://suite3d.com/painting/planetarysuite.shtml) and many similar desktop wallpapers around the place, I wanted an Android theme that suited my aesthetic and also fit my icon layout.

So, with some photoshop work, some changes to the [Nova Launcher](http://novalauncher.com/) grid layout, and the incredible ["Min" Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min), I came up with this:

### How To

- Install [Nova Launcher](http://novalauncher.com/) ([Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&hl=en))

- In the "Nova Settings" app, go to Desktop > Desktop Grid and change it to 7 rows, and whatever columns you want:

- Install ["Min" Icon Pack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min)

- Download and apply my wallpaper:

_Yes, it's missing Neptune. Just due to the slice size and overall layout I wanted, there wasn't space. I'll probably make a different version without the Sun soon, and just a large sliced planet, which has all the planets and some sliced moons._

As a bonus, here's a little GIF showing the layers. I meant to record the entire process timelapse-style but completely forgot.

title: "Scrap Wood Leg Support"
summary: Due to my physical disability requiring my leg be elevanted for a majority of the day, and every recliner on the market ending at the calf (and therefore not supporting the leg properly), I decided to design and build my own leg rest that lets me sit at my computer chair more comfortably.

Due to [permanent disability](/about/), my leg basically needs to stay elevated for 90% of the day, and every single recliner and leg-rest-type furniture I've found/tried has been designed to support your mid-calf-muscle area and have the rest of your leg sticking off the edge, which hurts for me. I've bought and abandoned more chairs/recliners/leg-rests/etc than I can count, and finally just decided to build my own.

First I mocked up the position and made sure the height cleared the speaker under my desk, and that the top height/angle suited my leg when I'm sitting at the desk.

After that I came up with a design in Fusion 360 that matched the mocked up lengths and angles, which lets me print off a cut sheet with more accurate details to take to the shed. I've gone to CAD'ing up any/all projects no matter how small, if only so that I have an easy reference to double-check details or compare to my progress and catch mistakes earlier. The "Drawing" mode in Fusion 360 is one of my favourite things lately, letting you auto-generate nice flat pictures from each angle with measurements and angles labelled clearly.

Then I threw a bunch of scrap MGP10 (2x4s for you right-side-up countries) through the thicknesser to clean it up and make it look a bit less... crap. Any project that uses scrap materials is a huge win in my books.

I assembled all the parts using a pocket hole jig so that the exterior could be as smooth/minimal as possible, and every joint is glued + screwed for extra rigidity/longevity.

Finally I gave it a heavy sanding using the orbital sander to get it all smooth and hide all my mistakes (so so many mistakes, I need to work on calibrating my tools better), and put on a few thick coats of some white wall paint I had lying around.

This is it, my "custom-made artisan leg support", aka some scrap wood that's been screwed together and hidden by generous amounts of paint and a pillow.

It's ridiculously comfortable, gives me full leg support down to the ankle, and the slight angle in it means I don't get blood flow issues or pins & needles from using it for too long. I've bought some furniture foam to make a custom cushion that fits better, but for now this pillow is working fine.
